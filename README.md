# Temp-Spoofer-Keyauth-Protected

This is a simple Temp Spoofer which uses the newest KeyAuth version as auth and simple AntiDebug to prevent reverse engineering. It has a only key login, instructions inside the loader after you logged in, a serial checker and the spoof option.

Its spoofs:
-MAC, VolumeID, BIOS, Baseboard, Diskdrive and Registry
-
All you need to do is to replace the KeyAuth credentials in the main.cpp file with your own and your good to go. You can use this project as you like.
